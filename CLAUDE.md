## What this app is

A private family accountability app. Family members living separately hold each other accountable to long-term personal growth using real money stakes, weekly goals, and family-assigned challenges.

---

## Core rules — memorize these

### Goals

- Every person has **maximum 2 active goals** at a time
- **Slot 1** — always self-chosen. Mandatory.
- **Slot 2** — chosen from nominations sent by family members. Optional until a nomination is accepted.
- If no nomination has been received, the person may optionally fill slot 2 themselves.
- A paused goal frees up its slot.
- Goals are **not deleted** — they are `active`, `paused`, or `completed`.

### Nominations (for slot 2)

- Any family member can nominate a goal for any other member.
- **One nomination per nominator per target** at a time.
- Multiple family members can nominate the same person simultaneously.
- The target person sees all pending nominations and **picks one freely**.
- When one nomination is accepted → all others are auto-declined.
- The person can optionally write a reason for their choice.
- The family can see which nomination was chosen and the reason.

### Weekly cycle

- Goals **reset every week** (Monday start, Sunday end).
- Each week is independent — missing last week has no effect on this week's counter except for the consecutive miss rule.
- At end of each week (Sunday night cron job):
  - Did the user meet their goal frequency? ✅ → no penalty, `consecutive_misses` resets to 0
  - Did not meet frequency? ❌ → penalty added to pot, `consecutive_misses` += 1

### Consecutive miss rule

- Miss **2 weeks in a row** → penalty added to pot **AND** a Challenge is triggered.
- One good week → `consecutive_misses` resets to 0 completely.

### Challenges (triggered by 2 consecutive misses)

- Same nomination logic as goals:
  - Family members each suggest a real-life action
  - The person picks one suggestion freely
  - Others are auto-declined
  - Person proves completion with photo/video upload
- After completing the challenge → `consecutive_misses` resets to 0.

### Group pot

- Accumulates from all penalties.
- Group votes on what to spend it on via proposals.
- Any member can propose a reward.
- Simple vote: thumbs up / thumbs down. Majority wins. Closes after 48 hours.

## Coding conventions

- Always use TypeScript. No `any` types.
- Always validate API inputs with Zod before touching the database.
- Always call `getUser()` from `lib/auth.ts` at the top of every API route to verify the session.
- Business logic lives in `lib/` — API routes only call lib functions and return responses.
- Use Prisma transactions when multiple tables must be updated together.
- Every API route returns `{ data, error }` shape consistently.
- Components are server components by default. Add `"use client"` only when needed.
- Use Tailwind for all styling. No inline styles.
